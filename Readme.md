SmallGames
==========

I tend to write an lot of small appications and a couple big ones when I get really into learning a programming language, this is no exception, in order to learn C++ and OpenGL I'm going to write a simple Engine and some games using that engine

Building
--------

- Change directory into Engine and run make, the engine will compile and run
